# create-lab
Create a hyper-v environment with powershell and WMF 5
The idea is to preprocess the physical and virtual machines in excel and then deploy them via powershell

in the end you will have a environment with a hyper-v cluster in the service area Infrastructrue (INFRA) and a virtualized Service Area (Plattform) and
then the same in the DMZ as a service delivery point to publich your services externaly

All will be done with focus on Objects and Powershell DSC
